# Local Impact Award

## Think Local Act Local
The local impact award is given to people that improve the quality of living, the environment, or address social responsibilities locally.

## Specific Needs Deserve Specific Solutions
Many issues are best addressed globally. However, your community has specific needs and issues, local culture and local problems that are better addressed with specific solutions - home grown! 

## The Benefit of Addressing Local Problems with Local Resources

* Building community: working on problems together helps people to better connect with others and to better understand their problems.
* Growing citizenship: taking on responsibilities connects us with the governance of our community.
* Expanding local knowledge: by addressing problems locally we grow the local knowledge base. 
* Saving resources: sourcing knowledge and material locally saves the cost of moving them around
